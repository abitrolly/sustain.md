# Sustainers Manifesto

Another maintainer stepped down today, another project became orphan, unmaintained, dead, bitrotten. The code is alive as long as it is in somebody's head. The code that is given free and open source is born to push progress forward. It challenges one's skills to prove that we can do better. It provides help for those who solve tough problems and for those who play business. Regardless of my psychological and physical properties, of my mood and behavior, I am the part of the open source community, I choose to change the gameplay rules to make people in my commnity thrive, and this is my manifesto.
